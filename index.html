       <h1>WILDLIFE</h1>
       <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">NationalGeographic</a>
          <p>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, 
             but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in 
             an area without being introduced by humans.Wildlife can be found
             in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains,
             areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in 
             popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by 
             human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is
             affected by human activities</p>

       <h3>FOTOS:</h3>
          <img src="img/lion.jpg" alt="LION" width="500">
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular,
               deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy
               tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; male lions have a prominent mane,
               which is the most recognisable feature of the species. With a typical head-to-body 
               length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in).
               It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few
               adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
               preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator, although
               some lions scavenge when opportunities occur, and have been known to hunt humans, 
               although the species typically does not.</p>
          <img src="img/leopard.jpg" alt="LEOPARD" width="425">
            <p>The leopard or panther (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus
               Panthera, a member of the Felidae.[4] It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa,
               in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and
               East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations 
               are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the
               global range. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in 
               Morocco,leopard populations have already been extirpated.[3] Contemporary records suggest
               that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.[5][6] Leopards are
               hunted illegally,and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal
               practices and decoration</p>
          <img src="img/tiger.jpg" alt="TIGER" width="500">
            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified
               in the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown
               fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as
               deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
               large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its
               offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent
               and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>
          <img src="img/deer.jpg" alt="DEER" width="480">
            <p>Deer (singular and plural) are the hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. 
               The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the
               fallow deer, and the chital; and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), the roe
               deer, and the moose. Female reindeer, and male deer of all species except the Chinese water
               deer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned antelope,
               which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).</p>
          <img src="img/puma.jpg" alt="PUMA" width="500">
            <p>Puma is a genus in the family Felidae that contains the cougar (also known as the puma,
               among other names), and may also include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives
               (for example, Puma pardoides, or Owen's panther, a large, cougar-like cat of Eurasia's Pliocene.
               In addition to these potential Old World fossils, a few New World fossil representatives are
               possible, such as Puma pumoides[4] and the two proposed species of the so-called "American
               cheetah".</p>
